# PyBeginner_projects

This repo documents several projects to practice Python for beginners. Those projects are are from [Mosh's Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc). 

# Project 1: Automation with Python

The first project is about how to process spreadsheet using Python. It will be very useful in situation where we have hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets that are very laborous if we deal with them manually. Python can process the spreadsheets with automation. 

Note that this is a very simple demo, and we can refer to the [documentation](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io)

# Project 2: Machine Learning with Python

For this project, we use the jupyter notebook since it makes it easier to inspect our data frequently.

The data (`music.csv`) a small simulated sample. That's not real data. 

The process to work on this small machine learning project follows the steps below: 

- Import the data
- Clearn the data
- Split the data into training/test sets
- Create a model and Train the model
- Make predictions
- Evaluate and Improve
- Additional: 
    + Save the trained model for future loading
    + Plot the decision tree
